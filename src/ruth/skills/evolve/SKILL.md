# Evolve

## Purpose

Use this skill when Ruth should inspect, propose, or govern a small
self-evolution step. Evolution is an evidence-to-change pipeline, not a generic
task runner:

```text
records -> evidence -> candidate -> recommendation -> human approval
        -> archived handoff -> normal task and review lifecycle
```

Backlog entries are ordinary deferred work and are never evolution evidence by
themselves.

## Modes

- `disabled`: do not scan, synthesize, or propose self-evolution.
- `co-evolve`: notice and recommend changes, but wait for human approval.
- `auto-evolve`: schedule the same semantic proposal flow, but still wait for
  human approval before queueing, removing, or merging anything.

The default is `co-evolve`. The current theme guides synthesis, brainstorming,
curation, and deterministic fallback ranking; it is context, not an evidence
source.

## Evidence pathways

Feedback and experience are two-stage pathways. They first create durable
evidence, then a separate reasoning pass may turn unlinked evidence into
candidate changes.

### Feedback

The feedback scanner reads unprocessed conversation turns in configurable
batches, defaulting to 20 user messages. Each record contains the exact user
message and Ruth reply, plus a stable `conversation:<id>` reference. Credential
values are redacted before the records leave storage.

The scanner runs in a fresh stateless runtime invocation. It receives no normal
conversation session and returns a strict JSON array of zero or more
observations. Simple words, phrases, and regular expressions do not classify
feedback.

### Experience

The experience scanner reads configurable batches of distinct changed task
IDs, defaulting to 20. Each record contains that task's complete ordered event
history from `.ruth/artifacts/task_events.jsonl`, not merely the last event.

The scan cursor records the latest event ID for each task. A later lifecycle
event makes that task pending again, so a completion followed by a regression
is rescanned with the full causal history. A failed task, successful task,
repeated workflow, or cron definition is not evidence by itself; the semantic
scanner must identify durable operational friction or an improvement signal.

### Scan contract

Both scanners:

- may return an empty array;
- may record at most ten evidence items per batch;
- must use the exact JSON schema and cite only supplied record references;
- record confidence and whether a human stated the signal explicitly;
- describe an observation and desired outcome, not a proposed implementation;
- advance their cursor only after a valid response; and
- leave every input pending after timeout, malformed JSON, unknown references,
  or another failed scan.

Threshold scans run from the daemon loop when evolution is enabled, the chat is
locked, no task worker is active, and a source reaches its configured batch
size. This also catches up after restart. `/evolve scan` forces and drains
unprocessed batches even below the threshold. `/evolve propose` and scheduled
evolve checks also force and drain both sources before selection.

## Evidence storage

Evidence settings are stored in `.ruth/evidence.json`.

Evidence is append-only in:

- `.ruth/artifacts/evidence.jsonl`
- `.ruth/artifacts/evidence_scans.jsonl`

An evidence item contains:

- `id`, `source`, observation type, and affected area;
- desired outcome, confidence, and explicit-human flag;
- immutable conversation, task, and task-event references;
- status and timestamps; and
- candidate IDs linked from that evidence.

Evidence is not deleted when it becomes a candidate. A linkage update changes
its latest status to `linked` while the earlier journal record remains. There
is currently no command that deletes evidence.

## Candidate pathways

Ruth has four candidate sources:

- `feedback`: synthesized from feedback evidence;
- `experience`: synthesized from task-history evidence;
- `learning`: applicable immutable skill assessments created through `/learn`;
- `brainstorming`: bounded ideas generated under the mission and theme.

Backlog is not a source. Active cron jobs, generic task failures, repeated
successes, inheritance changes, and learning artifacts do not become hardcoded
candidates. Inheritance has its own assessed inbox and explicit `/inherit
<change_id>` task workflow. Cron, recovery, backlog promotion, approval, and
scheduling remain task triggers; a task they create can later be semantically
scanned through experience.

Candidate synthesis is a second fresh stateless reasoning invocation. It sees
only unlinked evidence, mission, theme, and a bounded summary of existing
candidates. It may return an empty array. Every returned candidate must:

- cite known evidence IDs;
- use evidence from only one source;
- be small, reversible, testable, and about improving Ruth;
- provide rationale, proposed change, benefit, risk, and test plan; and
- pass protected-scope and dangerous-action validation.

Candidate records preserve `evidence_ids` and original `evidence_refs`.
Feedback/experience candidates from the retired hardcoded pathways are retained
for audit but removed from the actionable pool when they lack evidence IDs.

The other two pathways create structured candidates directly: learning from
applicable immutable skill assessments and brainstorming from one dedicated
bounded generation pass.

### Brainstorming

`/evolve brainstorm [theme]` starts one fresh stateless, read-only Codex
session. It receives Ruth's mission, the selected theme, declared skills, up
to 30 existing candidates, and up to 12 recent completed-work summaries. It may
inspect the repository read-only to check novelty.

The session must return an exact JSON array containing zero to three complete
candidate drafts. Ruth then validates required fields, field bounds,
protected scope, dangerous actions, and duplicates before writing candidates
directly to `.ruth/evolve_candidates.json`. There is no brainstorming
artifact or later conversion pass.

Brainstorm candidates retain their source theme, a hash of the bounded context,
and their creation time. They remain visible after the theme changes; an exact
theme match only improves current ranking.

`/evolve propose` never starts brainstorming implicitly. In `co-evolve`,
brainstorming is explicit only. A scheduled `auto-evolve` check first scans
evidence and performs evidence-to-candidate synthesis. If no visible candidate
then exists, it may invoke this same brainstorming pathway at most once per
theme every 24 hours. It still only proposes the result for human approval.

## Recommendation

After synthesis, semantic curation is a third fresh stateless reasoning
invocation. Deterministic scoring only bounds and orders its input and supplies
an explicitly labelled fallback.

The curator can recommend one known candidate or suggest that a human remove an
item as duplicate, superseded, obsolete, already resolved, context-only, or not
actionable. It cannot invent candidates, approve, queue, remove, merge, deploy,
change permissions, or mutate mission or identity.

Curations are appended to `.ruth/evolve_curations.jsonl`. Candidates are
stored in `.ruth/evolve_candidates.json`, and proposal, decision, and handoff
events are appended to `.ruth/artifacts/evolve_events.jsonl`.

## Candidate-to-task handoff

Candidates have only a decision lifecycle:

- `candidate`: active and available for proposal, approval, or removal.
- `approved`: archived after a normal task was successfully queued.
- `removed`: archived after a human removal decision.

Approval copies the full candidate context and provenance into the task and
records an immutable candidate-to-task link. The task then exclusively owns
execution, retries, worktrees, commits, reviews, and outcomes. Use `/tasks` and
`/task retry <task_id>` after handoff. `/evolve candidates` shows only active
candidates; `/evolve candidates all` includes the archive.

## Commands

- `/evolve` — read-only dashboard
- `/evolve evidence [feedback|experience|all]`
- `/evolve scan [feedback|experience|all]`
- `/evolve candidates [all]`
- `/evolve propose`
- `/evolve brainstorm [theme]`
- `/evolve approve <id>`
- `/evolve remove <id> [reason]`
- `/evolve config`
- `/evolve config mode <disabled|co-evolve|auto-evolve>`
- `/evolve config theme <text>`
- `/evolve config feedback-batch <1-100>`
- `/evolve config experience-batch <1-100>`
- `/evolve config schedule <text>`

There are no top-level `/feedback`, `/experience`, or `/propose` aliases, and
the older `/evolve list`, `/evolve mode`, `/evolve theme`, and
`/evolve schedule` forms are not commands. `/help evolve` is the authoritative
command reference.
